Determining the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) between the Maximum Common Substructures (MCS) of two molecules.

The Kuhn-Munkres Hungarian algorithm allows for a fast match of atoms based on:
- atomic symbol
- Sybyl atom types
- pharmacophoric types (i.e. H-bond donors and acceptors or charges)
